When playing other TTRPGS, I noticed that they have a lot of player-created (a.k.a. homebrew) content.

What interested me was that none of the systems seem to have been made for making things up- althought it was always certainly possible.

I decided to make my own system for me and my friends (hi guys) to play, and maybe one day I'll release it to the wider world.
