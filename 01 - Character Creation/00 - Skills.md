### *What are they?*
The stats in the game are, by default:
- Strength
- Agility
- Charisma
- Insight
- and three fillable skills.

The three other skills are all setting/campaign specific. 

For example, maybe you want to set a campaign in a magic school.

You might want an Arcana skill, or other stats like Wisdom. Maybe you even want each player to have a special skill of their own (adventurous!). Whatever the case, the system is flexible.

### *Assigning Skills*
When you make your character, you start with a 0 across the board. This represents a regular person in your world.

Of course, you're not regular, are you? As such, when you make your character, you have an extra 5 points you can distribute anywhere you'd like.

You can also subtract from your points and transfer the difference to another skill, up to 3 points total.
