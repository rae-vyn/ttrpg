Traits are, well, traits your character has. They can modify skill checks or other areas of the game.

There are two types of traits: Inherited and Developed.

Inherited Traits are simpler and come from factors like species or upbringing. Developed Traits are pronounced over the course of your game.

Here's another, more trivial one:

> ***Catcher***
> You've played a ball-based sport for a while, and you're pretty good, if you do say so yourself. You can catch almost anything at this point with pretty good consistency.
