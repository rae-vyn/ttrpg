Health in this system is pretty simple. To find your max HP when making your character, roll a d20 and add your strength. If you have any Traits that modify your strength or health, add them as well.

When you take damage, reduce your HP appropriately on your sheet. Upon reaching zero HP, you die.

> If you want to implement some sort of downing system, [[01 - Health Mechanics|you can]].

If you have an item that has a healing factor, you can use it according to its rules.
