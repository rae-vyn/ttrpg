Every character starts at level 1. Every time you level up, you can do these things:
1. You get two points to add to your skills.
2. You can take up to two points away from your current skills, to be distributed elsewhere.
3. Depending on your GM, you can add another trait.

*How* you level up depends on the DM. Some may use an XP system, some may use some sort of milestone system, or you might just level up after every session.

> Nothing says you can't level up more than once at a time, either.
