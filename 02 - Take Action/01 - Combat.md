Combat in this system, unlike others, doesn't have an order by default. Instead, the combat happens asynchronously with the rest of the world.

Combat usually happens when someone gets attacked, and ends whenever a character passes out, dies, flees, or surrenders.

Evasive maneuvers or blocking are contested rolls of whatever skill is applicable.

Any attack does one d10 of damage, plus any modifiers gained from weapons or traits.

The most basic weapon is your bare hands, which get no modifiers by default.
